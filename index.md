## About
Hello, I'm currently a student at the University of Alberta, and I'm a maintainer of the [ScottPlot](https://github.com/ScottPlot/ScottPlot) plotting library.

This is where I post technical content, mostly things that come up in my work that I think could be beneficial to a wider audience.
