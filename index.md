Hello, I'm Benjamin Lehmann, a student at the University of Alberta, and a maintainer of the [ScottPlot](https://github.com/ScottPlot/ScottPlot) plotting library.

This is where I post technical content, mostly things that come up in my work that I think could be beneficial to a wider audience. The source for this blog is available on [GitHub](github.com/bclehmann/bclehmann.github.io)
